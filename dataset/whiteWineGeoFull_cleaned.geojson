    "description":"An enticing smell of lemon sorbet fills the nose and the effect on the palate is much the same: bracing, cleansing deliciousness pervades everything. There is a hint of crunchy, crisp green apple combined with far richer notions of lemon zest and mandarin peel. Deeper down resides an earthy, yeasty core and a salty, stoniness. This is very young now and will show its true but thrilling citrus-tinted colors with some bottle age. Drink 2018–2025.",

There is an undertow of riper texture, reminiscent of bitter orange zest and just as full of aromatic promise. This is wiry and slender but will mellow into seductive freshness and slick, almost cheeky tartness.

Aromas of African violets and cocoa nibs marry harmoniously with the fleshy black-fruit core. Jammy, ripe plum and cherry flavors lead the lush and slightly creamy palate, transitioning into notes of roasted coffee and chocolate, and finally ending on a sweet toasted-oak and baking-spice accent. It's richly delicious now, but patience will also be rewarded; try after 2016.",
